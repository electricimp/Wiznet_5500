# Wiznet W5500 2.2.0 #

The W5500 chip is a hardwired TCP/IP embedded Ethernet controller. We have two libraries for use with the [Wiznet W5500 chip](http://wizwiki.net/wiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=products:w5500:w5500_ds_v106e_141230.pdf).

The base library allows you to communicate with a TCP/IP network (separate from an imp’s connection to the network). This library supports SPI integration with the W5500. See documentation [below](#w5500-class-usage).

In addition we have a W5500.DHCP library that enables Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) functionality for the [Wiznet W5500 chip](http://wizwiki.net/wiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=products:w5500:w5500_ds_v106e_141230.pdf). Documentation and source code can be found in the [DHCP directory](./DHCP).

The W5500 is used by the [impAccelerator&trade; Fieldbus Gateway](https://developer.electricimp.com/hardware/resources/reference-designs/fieldbusgateway).

**To include the base library in your project, add** `#require "W5500.device.lib.nut:2.2.0"` **at the top of your device code**

## W5500 Class Usage ##

### Constructor: W5500(*interruptPin, spi[, csPin][, resetPin][, autoRetry][, setMac]*) ###

The constructor configures, resets then initializes the Wiznet chip. The reset process is blocking and can take a number of seconds. The initialization process then runs asynchronously, so be sure to register an [onReady callback](#onreadycallback) before opening a connection or listener.

| Parameter | Data&nbsp;Type | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *interruptPin* | imp **pin** object | Yes | The pin represents a physical pin on the imp and is used for receiving interrupts from the W5500 chip. The pin can be any digital input that supports a callback on pin state change |
| *spi* | imp **spi** object | Yes | A configured SPI object |
| *csPin* | imp **pin** object | No | The pin represents a physical pin on the imp and is used to select the SPI bus. On the imp005 if you do not pass a pin into *csPin* you must configure the SPI with the *USE_CS_L* constant, Default: `null` |
| *resetPin* | imp **pin** object | No | The pin represents a physical pin on the imp and is used for sending a hard reset signal to the W5500 chip |
| *autoRetry* | Boolean | No | Whether the library should automatically retry to open a connection should one fail. Default: `false`. **Note** Not yet implemented |
| *setMac* | Boolean | No | Whether the library should set the MAC address of the chip to the imp’s own MAC (with the locally administered bit flipped). This should be set to `false` when using a Wiznet Wiz550io board, since it has its own MAC address. Default: `true` |

#### Examples ####

```squirrel
// Setup for an imp005 Fieldbus Gateway

interruptPin <- hardware.pinXC;
resetPin     <- hardware.pinXA;

// Initialize SPI
spiSpeed     <- 1000;
spi          <- hardware.spi0;
spi.configure(CLOCK_IDLE_LOW | MSB_FIRST | USE_CS_L, spiSpeed);

// Initialize Wiznet
wiz <- W5500(interruptPin, spi, null, resetPin);
```

```squirrel
// Setup for an impC001

// Configure pins
cs           <- hardware.pinS;
resetPin     <- hardware.pinYC;
// Note: This is not the default interrupt pin for the mikroBus.
// The default pin YD doesn't allow for a state change callback.
// Apply solder bridge to W4 on back of breakout board to connect
// interrupt to pin YL.
interruptPin <- hardware.pinYL;

// Initialize SPI
speed        <- 1000;
spi          <- hardware.spiPQRS;
spi.configure(CLOCK_IDLE_LOW | MSB_FIRST, speed);

// Initialize Wiznet
wiz <- W5500(interruptPin, spi, cs, resetPin);
```

```squirrel
// Setup for an imp001

// Configure pins
cs           <- hardware.pin8;
resetPin     <- hardware.pin9;
interruptPin <- hardware.pin1;

// Initialize SPI
speed        <- 1000;
spi          <- hardware.spi257
spi.configure(CLOCK_IDLE_LOW | MSB_FIRST, speed);

// Initialize Wiznet
wiz <- W5500(interruptPin, spi, cs, resetPin);
```

| Parameter | Data&nbsp;Type | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *port* | An integer | Yes | The port to listen on for connections |
| *callback* | Function | Yes | A callback function that is passed an error message, or the established remote connection is established. The table below lists its parameters |

    } else {
        local ip = connection.getIP();
        local port = connection.getPort();
        server.log(format("Connection established from %d.%d.%d.%d:%d", ip[0], ip[1], ip[2], ip[3], port));
    }
}.bindenv(this))
```

### reset(*[softReset]*) ###

This method causes the Wiznet chip to undergo a reset and re-initialization. The reset is a blocking operation that will take 1+ seconds to close each socket that is in use, as well as 1+ second for the actual chip reset. When the reset operation is complete an asynchronous initialization is performed. When initialization is complete the [callback registered with *onReady()*](#onreadycallback) is triggered. It is recommended that you use the *onReady* callback to reconfigure and continue Wiznet operation. The data sheet for the Wiznet chip recommends a hardware reset (the default behavior), however no reset pin is configured the optional parameter can be used to perform a software reset.

#### Parameters ####

| Parameter | Data&nbsp;Type | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *softReset* | Boolean | No | Pass `true` to trigger a soft reset, or `false` for a hard reset. Default: `false` |

#### Returns ####

Nothing.

#### Examples ####

```squirrel
// Perform a hardware reset
wiz.onReady(function() {
    // Reset complete, so configure the Wiznet 5500 here
}.bindenv(this));
wiz.reset();
```

```squirrel
// A software reset
wiz.onReady(function() {
    // Reset complete, so configure the Wiznet 5500 here
}.bindenv(this));
wiz.reset(true);
```

### setNumberOfAvailableSockets(*numSockets*) ###

This method configures the Wiznet 5500’s buffer memory allocation by dividing the available memory between the number of required sockets evenly. If you need a greater buffer per socket, allocate fewer sockets. The default behavior is to allocate eight sockets.

#### Parameters ####
